msgid "Picnics in a sheltered hollow, hide and seek... sand dunes are a familiar and natural playground. Less well known is their role as a sanctuary for endangered plants and animals like the fen orchid and sand lizard. But our sand dunes are under threat. They are becoming more and more densely covered by grass and scrub while our wildlife needs areas of open sand to thrive. Healthy sand dunes need to move and be dynamic."
