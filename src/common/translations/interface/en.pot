msgid "The aim of this activity is twofold. Firstly, to measure the length of the sand dune and secondly, combining this with recording where zones change from one to another along each transect. Photographing and noting the GPS location of transitions between different zones of the sand dune system will help to monitor how these boundaries change over time. Transitions are the abrupt or gradual change of habitat from one type to another, for example from a mobile dune to a semi-fixed, or to other habitats of fixed dune, bare sand around newly restored/scraped areas or blowouts, scrub encroachment, and dune slack boundaries."
